  <h2 align="center">Analyzing Contributions of Storm Drivers to Compound Flooding Using Coupled Modeling and Machine Learning Approaches</h2>
</p>

<br>

## Introduction :book:

This repository, [si2023-compound-flooding](https://github.com/javedali99/si2023-compound-flooding), is dedicated to an in-depth analysis of the contributions of various flood drivers to compound flooding in New York City (NYC). Compound flooding is a complex phenomenon involving the interplay of various factors such as storm surges, heavy rainfall, and river discharge. These factors interact in complex ways, making it difficult to isolate their individual contributions to overall flooding. Understanding and quantifying the contributions of these factors is essential for effective flood risk management, infrastructure planning, and climate change adaptation strategies.

### Background üåç

New York City is one of the most flood-prone areas in the United States, with a coastline that stretches for over 500 miles. As a hub of economic activity and population density, it is imperative to protect the city against the adverse impacts of flooding. The city has experienced several major flooding events in the past, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused over $19 billion in damages and claimed 43 lives. The city is also vulnerable to future flooding events, with sea levels projected to rise by 11 to 30 inches by the 2050s and 18 to 60 inches by the 2080s. The city is also expected to experience more frequent and intense precipitation events in the future, which will further exacerbate the risk of flooding. In this context, understanding the drivers of compound flooding and their interactions becomes even more important. This project aims to address this need by analyzing the contributions of various flood drivers to compound flooding in NYC.

## Objectives :dart:

The primary objective of this study is to understand and quantify the contributions of various flood drivers to compound flooding in different parts of NYC under various storm and flooding scenarios. The project uses a combination of coupled modeling and machine learning approaches to quantify the contributions of various flood drivers to compound flooding in NYC. This knowledge will help in prioritizing simulation scenarios, optimizing the allocation of modeling resources, and devising more effective flood risk mitigation strategies.

## Coupled Modeling ‚öôÔ∏è

To analyze the drivers of compound flooding, we employ a coupled modeling approach that integrates hydrologic and hydrodynamic models. This allows for the simultaneous representation of different processes that contribute to flooding.

### Hydrologic Modeling using NextGen CFE Model üíß

---

The [National Water Center's Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) model](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cfe) is a type of rainfall-runoff model. It's a conceptual model, meaning it's designed to represent complex hydrological processes using simplified, easy-to-understand concepts. The model is designed to simulate how rainfall gets converted into runoff, a key process in understanding how much water will flow into rivers and streams after a rain event. It's designed with an implementation of the Basic Model Interface, a standard set of functions and procedures designed to facilitate model coupling in integrated environmental modeling studies.

Steps:

1. Hydrofabrics: Generate hydroFabrics subsets for your area of interest.
2. CFE Forcing: Prepare basin averaged forcing for nextgen cfe model
3. Configuration: Define model parameters.
4. Model Execution: Run the CFE model.
5. Output Analysis: Analyze runoff and other hydrologic outputs for flood events.

#### Generate HydroFabrics Subsets for the 8 watersheds in New York City (NYC) area

Retrieve hydrofabric data, followed by the extraction of necessary infromation for creating the parameter configuration file. These files are created for running Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) model and Simple Logical Tautology Handler (SLoTH) in the NGEN framework.

_**Watersheds:** ['wb-694856', 'wb-694725', 'wb-694855', 'wb-694724', 'wb-694854', 'wb-694723', 'wb-698891', 'wb-694722']_

#### Prepare Basin Averaged Forcing for NextGen CFE Model

Prepare basin averaged forcing input from for the NOAA Next Generation (NextGen) Water Resource Modeling Framework from AORC v1.0 kerchunk header files.

#### Run CFE Model in NGEN Framework

To run the _ngen_ engine, the following command line positional arguments are supported:

- _catchment_data_path_ -- path to catchment data geojson input file.
- _catchment subset ids_ -- list of comma separated ids (NO SPACES!!!) to subset the catchment data, i.e. 'cat-0,cat-1', an empty string or "all" will use all catchments in the hydrofabric
- _nexus_data_path_ -- path to nexus data geojson input file
- _nexus subset ids_ -- list of comma separated ids (NO SPACES!!!) to subset the nexus data, i.e. 'nex-0,nex-1', an empty string or "all" will use all nexus points
- _realization_config_path_ -- path to json configuration file for realization/formulations associated with the hydrofabric inputs
- _partition_config_path_ -- path to the partition json config file, when using the driver with [distributed processing](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen/blob/master/doc/DISTRIBUTED_PROCESSING.md).
- `--subdivided-hydrofabric` -- an explicit, optional flag, when using the driver with [distributed processing](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen/blob/master/doc/DISTRIBUTED_PROCESSING.md), to indicate to the driver processes that they should operate on process-specific subdivided hydrofabric files.

**Command to run the CFE model in NGEN framework:**

```bash
ngen config/catchments.geojson "" config/nexus.geojson "" config/realization.json ""
```

```bash
ngen <catchment_data_path> <catchment subset ids> <nexus_data_path> <nexus subset ids> <realization_config_path>
```

To simulate every catchment in the input hydrofabric, leave the subset lists empty, or use "all" i.e.:

```bash
ngen ./data/catchment_data.geojson "" ./data/nexus_data.geojson "" ./data/refactored_example_realization_config.json

ngen ./data/catchment_data.geojson "all" ./data/nexus_data.geojson "all" ./data/refactored_example_realization_config.json
```

### Hydrodynamic Modeling using GeoClaw Model üåä

---

The [GeoClaw model](https://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw.html) specializes in modeling geophysical flows like storm surges and tsunamis. It‚Äôs particularly effective at capturing the dynamics of storm surges, which is critical for understanding compound flooding in coastal areas. GeoClaw is one of the models available in [Geopack](https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack). GeoClaw is a coastal model that uses variable resolution to optimise model run times.

Steps:

1. Configuration: Set up model parameters such as bathymetry, topography, and friction.
2. Storm Data: Input storm track data and meteorological forcing.
3. Model Execution: Run the GeoClaw model.
4. Output Analysis: Analyze storm surge levels and other hydrodynamic outputs.

## Machine Learning Approaches ü§ñ

Various machine learning models are employed to analyze the data obtained from the coupled modeling to understand and quantify the contributions of various flood drivers to compound flooding under various storm and flooding scenarios in NYC. These algorithms are selected for their ability to handle high-dimensionality, capture non-linear relationships, and model temporal sequences.

- **Random Forest (RF)**: A versatile and powerful algorithm, RF is employed to handle the nonlinear relationships between the flood drivers and the resulting flooding. By offering feature importance scores, RF helps to identify the most influential drivers, quantifying their individual contributions.

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: SVR is an implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression problems. It is designed to find the best fit line in a high or infinite dimensional space, which is defined by a set of predictors. In this study, we use SVR to predict the flood levels in different scenarios based on the corresponding drivers. This helps us to understand the effects of the flood drivers on the severity of compound flooding.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: MLP, a type of artificial neural network, is effective in capturing complex patterns in the dataset and modeling non-linear relationships. By employing MLP, we can model the intricate interactions between various flood drivers and their collective impact on compound flooding.

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: LSTM networks are a subtype of recurrent neural networks designed to learn patterns in time-series data. This makes them particularly suited for our study, where we are interested in understanding the temporal aspects of flood events, including the progression and interaction of various flood drivers over time.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming it into a set of orthogonal components that capture the most variance. By using PCA, we can simplify the complex multidimensional relationships between flood drivers, making it easier to visualize and understand the key drivers.

Each of these machine learning methods contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of compound flooding in NYC, thereby helping to achieve our study's main objective.
